# Repository: GOO-PY

This repository contains solutions (i.e. completed exercises) for the [Python course instructed by Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), and was pushed to GitHub to provide a useful resource for other programmers undertaking the course. Whilst the solutions pass all of the test cases, I'm not suggesting that they are optimal, but merely an alternative to those provided by Google.

The test data is available within the [exercises archive provided by Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/google-python-exercises.zip).
